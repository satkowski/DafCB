Implement & eval 2 "EM" algorithms for PWM finding

  1.  Explain your guess procdure. Pseudocode & why
  2.  Implement "EM" as given in class
  3.  Implement: t=0... Until M convergences Find z^t+c = argmax_Z Pr(S|Z,M^+) Find M^t+1 = argmax_M Pr(S|Z^+,M)
  4.  Compare 2) and 3) empirently & give your best explanation of how they differ
